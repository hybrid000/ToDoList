# ToDo List Web Application

The ToDo List web application is a simple tool that allows users to manage their tasks and create custom to-do lists. This project is built using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. It provides a user-friendly interface for adding, viewing, and deleting tasks within both a general to-do list and custom lists.

## Features

- **General To-Do List:** The application includes a general to-do list where users can add, view, and delete tasks that are not associated with any specific custom list.

- **Custom Lists:** Users can create their own custom lists by accessing the application through a unique URL. Each custom list can have its own set of tasks, which can be managed independently.

- **Add Tasks:** Users can add new tasks to either the general list or a specific custom list. The tasks can be entered through a user interface, and the application ensures that empty tasks are not added.

- **View Tasks:** Users can view the tasks in both the general list and custom lists. The application displays the tasks on the user interface, providing an organized and easily accessible view.

- **Delete Tasks:** Users can delete tasks from both the general list and custom lists. The application allows users to remove specific tasks, keeping the lists up to date and removing completed or unnecessary items.
